This repository is full of different projects that I have encountered in digital system designing in a Verilog Hardware Language that I want to share
with the public. Let this be thought of as a guide rather than given solutions for a course and if you are not participating in this course please
try these projects and codes out to learn what is going on with the operations taking place. The FPGA that this code was used for was the Basys3 which 
is an explanation for the hardware implementation shown in the constraints files.

Each Lab's Ideal Design Goal:

Lab 1B: Introduction to Logic Chips                    
Lab 1C: CMOS Logic and Intro to Oscilloscopes
Lab 2: Stop Light Controller
Lab 3: Combinational Logic
Lab 4: Sequential Logic
Lab 5a: State-Machine
Lab 5B: Bidirectional Shift Register
Lab 6: Multiplier
